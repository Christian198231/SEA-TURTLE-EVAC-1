        <br><br>
        <p>We want to rehabilitate, release injured sea turtles, and of course educate the public and assist with conservation efforts for all marine life.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>We own a rehabilitation center in Vacaville, Ca. We allow visitors from all over the world to come and see our rescued turtles, see what we do behind the scenes, learn the ways they live in the wild, and learn how we rescue the turtles that need our help.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>We would love for you to take action and help save the sea turtles! And the best part... it's easy! All you have to do is, recycle, cut up egg containers and plastics that turtles can get caught in and share this cause with others.</p>

        <div class="conservation-text">
        <p>Every year, multiple species of sea turtles come ashore to lay eggs on the beaches of South Padre Island and Boca Chica Beach. The most common nesting female we encounter is the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii). The Kemp’s ridley is  critically endangered due to decades of egg harvesting in their primary nesting grounds of Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and mortality related to shrimp fisheries before the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TED) . Today, there are multiple government agencies and non-profit organizations in both Mexico and the United States working towards saving this critically endangered species of sea turtle.
            <br><br>
            Since 1996, <span>SEA TURTLE EVAC</span> has participated in the bi-national efforts to protect the Kemp’s ridley and other species of sea turtles that come ashore to lay eggs. Between September 3 and November 21, our interns and volunteers conduct daily patrols in the 50 southernmost miles of Texas’ beaches looking for sea turtle nesting activity. If we encounter a nesting female, we carefully tag the turtle, take a biopsy sample, and collect morphometric data in collaboration with Dr. Donna Shaver’s mark and recapture program started at Padre Island National Seashore in 1991. Once the nesting female is safely back in the water, we excavate her eggs and relocate them to a hatchery for safe incubation. After a period of 45 to 55 days, hatchlings emerge from the nest cavities and we safely release them to the Gulf of Mexico under moonlight and away from city lights. When conditions allow, we hold public hatchling releases.

        <p>Sea turtles play a vital role in preserving the health of the world’s oceans. They maintain marine habitats, assist with nutrient cycling, provide habitat for other marine organisms, and help sustain balanced food webs. 
            <br><br>
            Extensive changes have occurred throughout ocean ecosystems due to declining sea turtle populations. Human-caused threats are pushing sea turtles towards extinction. As their numbers continue to decline, so does their ability to fulfill their vital roles in the ecosystem. 
            <br><br>
            Our goal is to educate the public about threats to sea turtles and their habitats as a step toward protecting them and ensuring healthy and resilient oceans for future generations. </p>
